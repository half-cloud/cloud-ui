[{"title":"Badges","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/cloud-ui/api/Badges","content":"On this page Badges Badges are used to display dynamic content. They can show labels, numbers, or other custom components. Usage When using a Badge, you don't put it inside of an element, rather you put the element inside of the Badge. caution Badges should only have one child, it cannot render multiple! local React = require(&quot;React&quot;) local Badge = require(&quot;mui.Badge&quot;) local Button = require(&quot;mui.Button&quot;) local ButtonWithBadge: React.FC&lt;{}&gt; = function() return React.createElement(Badge, { ...badgeProps }, { React.createElement(Button, { ...buttonProps }) }) end Badge Components A neat feature about badges, is that you can add whatever kind of content you want inside of them. In the example below, we create a Badge component that will have the number 5, as well as an icon right below it. local React = require(&quot;React&quot;) local Badge = require(&quot;mui.Badge&quot;) local Icon = require(&quot;mui.Icon&quot;) type Props = { icon: string, } local IconTextBadge: React.FC&lt;Props&gt; = function(props) return React.createElement(Badge, { content = { 5, React.createElement(Icon, { icon = props.icon, key = &quot;Icon&quot;, }), } }) end ","keywords":""}]
